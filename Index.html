    <h3> Welcome! </h3>
    <p> Welcome to the CUNY2X internship assistance landing page. CUNY2X offers assistance to students who are seeking help in finding an internship that is right for them. <br> <!-- paragraph that explains the program to students.-->
        We offer many resources like tips on how to get ready for an interview and also how to create a resum√®. It is our duty and responsibility to provide the help needed <br>
        so that the student can achieve their goals and land the job and internship they want.
    </p>

    <h4> Internship assistance </h4>
    <p>The CUNY2X program provides assistance to students with a Job board that provides listings to current internships along with information on the company like the job title,<br>
        name of company, location, and salary (if there is any). The internships provide a good opportunity to gain hands-on experience and learn more about the field you would like <br>
        to pursue.</p>
    <p>The objective for the internship is to provide the students with: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Interacting with professionals in the field.</li>
        <li>Gain experience in the specific field that is chosen.</li>
        <li>Develop professional relationships.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5> Job Board</h5>
    <p> One of the many things that CUNY2X offers is an active job board that displays jobs and can help nudge the student forward into finding an internship they would like to participate in. <br>
        The Job board has information like the name of the company, position of the job, mode of work, and a description of the company. The students can use these aspects to help aid them into <br>
        fining the job that they want. Click on the button below to transport you to the job board page and start browsing. <br>
